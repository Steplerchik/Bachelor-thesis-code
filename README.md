# New Ring Specimen Investigation
New kind of ring specimens were developed before to better estimate critical fracture mechanic parameters of pipes. The goal of this thesis is to investigate an influence of specimen geometry parameters on Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) along all the crack tip.

Two-parameter fracture mechanicsfracture mechanics is uses here. SIF - is the first parameter, biaiaxiality ratio is the second one.

All code is written in APDL (Ansys language).
